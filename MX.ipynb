    "**Interpretation:** To determine if a sample is representative of a population that is normally distributed, one frequently employs the Shapiro-Wilk test. A greater p-value denotes less compelling evidence against normalcy. Since both p-values in this instance are higher than the usually accepted significance level of 0.05, it is clear that neither the male nor the female groups' assumptions about normalcy should be strongly refuted.\n",
